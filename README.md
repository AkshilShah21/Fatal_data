# US Fatal Police Shootings Data Analysis (2015-2017)

This project analyzes **The Washington Post's** database of fatal police shootings in the U.S. from **January 1, 2015, to July 2017**. The dataset includes key details about each incident, such as the **age**, **race**, and **gender** of the victim, whether they were armed, and if they were experiencing a **mental health crisis**.

The data has been compiled from sources like law enforcement websites, local news, social media, and independent databases. Through this analysis, I explore patterns and trends to better understand the context of these tragic events.

## Data Sources

- percentage of people below poverty line
- percentage of people completed high school
- share of rac by city
- Fatalities of people by US police

## Key Features

- Data analysis of fatal police shootings
- Visualizations of patterns and trends
- Insights into the intersection of law enforcement, race, and mental health

## conculsion 

This analysis sheds light on critical social, economic, and systemic issues across the United States by evaluating trends and disparities in police-related fatalities, poverty, education, and race distribution.

**Poverty and Education**
The poverty rate varied significantly by state, with New Jersey having the lowest at 8.11% and Mississippi the highest at 27%. Similarly, the high school graduation rate ranged from 76% in Texas to 92.38% in Mississippi. A clear relationship emerged: states with higher poverty rates tended to have lower high school graduation rates, showing how economic hardship impacts educational outcomes.

**Racial Distribution**
Texas and New Mexico had the highest Hispanic populations, at 39% and 45%, respectively. Washington, D.C., stood out for having a majority Black population (50%), exceeding the proportion of White residents. Asian populations were consistently lower across all states, while in Alaska, Native Americans and Whites were equally represented.

**Fatalities by Race and Gender**
From 2015 to 2017, police-related fatalities totaled 2,535 individuals. Racially, 51.3% were White, 26.4% Black, and 18% Hispanic. By gender, 2,428 men and 107 women were killed. For unarmed individuals, Whites accounted for 39% of deaths, Blacks 37%, and Hispanics 20%.

**Age and Armed Status**
The median age of individuals killed was around 35. The youngest male killed was 6 years old, while the youngest female was 12. Most victims (93.23%) were armed, predominantly with guns (62%). Others were armed with knives (16.72%), vehicles (7.93%), or toy weapons (4.66%). Only 6.77% of the deceased were unarmed.

**Mental Health and Fleeing**
Almost 25% of individuals killed showed signs of mental illness, highlighting the need for specialized intervention. Regarding fleeing, most victims (72%) did not attempt to escape, while 485 tried to flee by car and 294 on foot across the years.

**Fatalities by State and Cities**
California had the highest number of police-related fatalities, despite a relatively low poverty rate. Mississippi, with the highest poverty rate, had fewer fatalities. Los Angeles recorded the most fatalities (39), with 52.77% of victims being Hispanic. Chicago had 24 fatalities, 87% of whom were Black. In Phoenix, 40% of those killed were White, and another 40% were Hispanic.

**Yearly and Quarterly Trends**
Fatalities peaked in 2015 (991 deaths) and decreased to 963 in 2016 and 581 in 2017. Quarterly data showed that Q3 of 2015 had the highest fatalities (280), while Q2 of 2017 recorded the fewest (225).
